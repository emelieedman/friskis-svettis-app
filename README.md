# Accessibility project

## About:
This project was initiated after doing user research among users with different disabilities. Through our research we had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how people with different disabilities used the web, what made it more difficult for them and what tools they used. We also got to hear their thoughts on how different websites/apps could be improved and this made us see the web in a new way. One user we talked to that had a visual impairement was unable to use the Friskis&svettis booking app because of how it was designed and built. We took a look at it and decided we wanted to re-design it and make it accessible for all users. This project is not officially connected to the company Friskis&Svettis, and is only a suggestion of how they could improve their app. Considering our user research I started to develop the design. After the images you can read a further explanation of what I have considered in the design to make it accessible. Although this started as a group project at Hyper Island, along the way I decided to code the app by myself for learning reasons, which is the code you see in this repository.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Accessible design considering:

### Visual imparement:
- Clear contrast between text & background
- Clear displayed focus on links & buttons
- Text sizing. Larger fontsize especially in headlines, but also in paragraph text

### Blind/Screen-reader/voice-over users:
- Clear structure & logic for easy navigation 
- New pages instead of overlays/pop-ups, to prevent
screen readers reading content behind pop-up  & also to make it
easier for the user to navigate the app.
- Explanatory headings, title & text 
- Booking confirmation to let the user know if the booking was successful.

### Dyslexia:
- Spacing between letters.
- Words in headlines starting with uppercase letters.

### Muscular deseases:
- Enough spacing between blocks to make it easy to scroll without accidentally
clicking something.
- Larger font-size in headlines for people navigating through eye-tracking

### Cognitive disabilities:
- Clean design without distracting moving objects.
- Pedagogical & intuitive design

### For all users:
- Calendar with many different options to pick a date depending
on what the user prefer. Input field to search for a date & a regular calendar.
- Clean & intuitive design that is accessible to all including visual users.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
